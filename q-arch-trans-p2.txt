I can see you have a detailed architectural plan for a sophisticated distributed medical transcript generation system. Let me read the file to understand the full context and then create the implementation.

Perfect! I can see you have an incredibly sophisticated architectural plan for a distributed medical transcript generation system. This is a comprehensive design that includes:

Core Features:

Distributed processing across multiple nodes (Pi 4/5, GPU machines)

Master/child architecture with intelligent work distribution

Thermal throttling and resource management

GAN-style quality improvement

RAG integration with massive public datasets

YouTube audio processing pipeline

Streaming data processing with reactive work assignment

Key Innovations:

Idle usage detection (gaming mode, work hours, etc.)

Multi-domain model specialization (healthcare, retail, telecom)

Natural language query interface

Continuous learning and model optimization

Real-time web dashboard

Multiple output formats (Lex, Dialogflow, etc.)

This is truly a sophisticated AI-powered transcript intelligence platform that goes far beyond simple generation - it's a complete ecosystem for creating, processing, and optimizing conversational training data at massive scale.

The architecture you've outlined would create a Netflix-style streaming system for transcript processing where data continuously flows through the pipeline, nodes automatically consume available work, and users see results in real-time.

When you're ready to start implementing, we could begin with any of these core components:

Master node orchestration - Central coordination and node discovery

Streaming pipeline architecture - Event-driven work distribution

YouTube processing pipeline - URL to transcript conversion

RAG integration - Public dataset ingestion and indexing

Web frontend - Dashboard and query interface

Which component would you like to tackle first when you're ready to start coding?

First, lets be smart, modular, use configs (in DB where reasonable) to manage things (no hard coding right) and decide on a good directory structure for this project now.

Perfect approach! Let's design a clean, modular architecture with proper configuration management and directory structure.

Project Directory Structure
Creating the project directory structure documentation

Now let's create the core configuration management system:

Creating the database schema for configuration and system management

Creating the main directory structure

by which I mean, create it IN the project directories/on disk

Creating the main directory structure

Creating subdirectories for the project structure

Creating the database schema for configuration and system management

Creating the default YAML configuration file

Creating the core configuration manager with database-first approach

Creating the database management utilities with connection pooling and data access objects

Creating the requirements.txt file with all necessary dependencies

Creating the environment variables template file

Creating the master node configuration profile

Creating the generation node configuration profile

Creating the processing node configuration profile

Creating the Raspberry Pi node configuration profile with hardware-specific optimizations

Creating the comprehensive README file for the project

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive, modular project structure with:

✅ Created Structure & Files:
Directory Structure
Complete modular architecture with logical separation

Core, master, nodes, pipeline, models, data, utils, api modules

Configuration, web interface, data storage, scripts, tests, docs

Configuration Management
Database-first approach with YAML fallbacks

ConfigManager class for dynamic configuration

Node profiles for different hardware types (master, generation, processing, Pi)

Environment variables template

Database Schema
Complete PostgreSQL schema with all necessary tables

Node registry, work queue, conversations, quality metrics

Proper indexing and relationships

Default configuration seeding

Core Components
ConfigManager: Database-first configuration with hot reloading

DatabaseManager: Connection pooling and data access objects

Node profiles: Specialized configs for different node types

Key Design Principles
✅ No hardcoding - All settings in database/config files
✅ Modular architecture - Clean separation of concerns
✅ Configuration-driven - Behavior controlled by config
✅ Scalable structure - Easy to extend and maintain
✅ Environment-aware - Different configs for different deployments

The structure supports:

Distributed processing across multiple machine types

Intelligent resource management with thermal/activity detection

Database-driven configuration with real-time updates

Specialized node profiles (desktop, Pi, server)

Clean modular design for easy development and testing

Ready to start implementing the core components! Which module would you like to tackle first - the master orchestrator, node discovery, or the streaming pipeline?

include mp4 process as well, coverting to "audio" and using... and mp3

Creating audio processor for MP4, MP3 and other formats

Creating YouTube processor that uses the audio processor

Creating YouTube processor that integrates with audio processor

Adding moviepy and ffmpeg dependencies for video processing

Updating database schema to support audio/video file processing

Updating database schema to support audio/video file processing

Updating database schema to support audio/video file processing

Creating media ingestion pipeline that handles all formats

✅ Added MP4/MP3 Processing Support:

New Components:
AudioProcessor (src/data/audio_processor.py)

Handles MP4, MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, OGG, AAC formats

Extracts audio from video files using MoviePy

Converts to normalized WAV format

Uses FFmpeg for format conversion

YouTubeProcessor (src/data/youtube_processor.py)

Integrates with AudioProcessor

Processes YouTube URLs and playlists

Extracts metadata and audio

MediaIngestionPipeline (src/data/media_ingestion.py)

Unified interface for all media types

Batch processing capabilities

Auto-detects format from file extension

Updated:
Database schema - Added support for audio/video file paths and metadata

Requirements - Added MoviePy and FFmpeg dependencies

Supported Formats:
Video: MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, WebM → Extract audio

Audio: MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, OGG, AAC → Direct processing

URLs: YouTube videos and playlists

The system now accepts any media file or YouTube URL, automatically extracts/processes audio, normalizes to 16kHz WAV, and feeds into the transcript generation pipeline.
