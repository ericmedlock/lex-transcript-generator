Okay, so I need to summarize the Fermi Paradox in three bullet points. Let me start by recalling what the Fermi Paradox is about. From what I remember, it's a question about the apparent contradiction between two observations: the vast number of galaxies estimated by modern astronomy, and the lack of evidence or contact with many extra planets that we'd expect given the age of the universe.

Wait, Eric Fermi asked why, if there are so many stars and planets forming around them, we haven'"

Okay, let's see. I need to summarize the Fermi Paradox in three bullet points. First, what is the Fermi Paradox? From what I remember, it's a question about the contradiction between ordinary star formation and the lack of evidence for repeating ultra-diffuse civilizations. Enrico Fermi posed the questions: ""Where are they?"" meaning if there are so many stars with potential for intelligent life, why haven't we seen any contact or signs of them?

So the paradox arises because big numbers"
